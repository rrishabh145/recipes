Recipe Of Hot Coffee (Instant Coffee)//Copied from internet.

In a cup take the instant coffee powder in required quantity. For 2 cups I am using 2 tsp of coffee powder. If you like strong coffee 
then do add 3 tsp instead, for 2 cups.

Now add sugar in the cup. You can adjust the quantity of sugar as per your liking. I have added 1 tbsp of sugar. Also depending on the 
sweetness of sugar and bitterness of coffee powder, adjust the quantity of sugar.

Once the sugar and coffee powder are added we are ready to add milk.

Add 1 tsp of Milk in the cup. You can also add water instead of milk.

Now with the help of a spoon, start mixing & whisking the coffee powder and sugar.	

Initially the coffee & sugar would look dark brown but once we whisk it more and more it starts turning into light brown and creamy.

Whisk for 5 minutes rigorously. The coffee cream is ready.

Pour hot (boiling) milk into  this coffee cream.

Mix the cream and milk with help of spoon. The froth should start appearing on top. This is the time when we know the coffee is ready. 
You can also transfer coffee from one cup to another to make it even more frothy.

Creamy homemade instant hot coffee is ready. Pour the coffee into serving cup and serve hot.
